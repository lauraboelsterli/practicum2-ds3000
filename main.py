Question #1

The goal is to analyze the FAA Wildlife Strike Database to identify patterns and trends in wildlife
strikes to civil aircraft. We must clean and reduce the dataset to only include relevant features for
the analysis. We must examine factors such as aircraft type, wildlife involved, location, and time.
After extracting factors like these we perform statistical tests, test hypotheses, and create visualizations
to help reduce the occurance and impact of wildlife strikes on civil aircraft in the future.
